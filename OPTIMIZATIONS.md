## Backend Optimizations

### Repository Pattern
- Implemented a base repository pattern for database operations.
- Created specialized repositories for each data model.
- Reduced code duplication and improved maintainability.

### Improved Caching
- Enhanced caching middleware with better key generation.
- Added cache invalidation for specific endpoints.
- Implemented ETag support for client-side caching.

### Error Handling
- Standardized error handling across the application.
- Added better logging for debugging.
- Improved error responses for the API.

### Authentication
- Enhanced token handling with automatic refresh.
- Added role-based authorization.
- Improved security for sensitive operations.

### Rate Limiting
- Implemented more granular rate limiting for different endpoints.
- Added protection against API abuse.

## Frontend Optimizations

### Chart Rendering
- Fixed issues with weekly chart data processing.
- Improved chart performance and appearance.
- Enhanced date handling for better accuracy.

### Goal Management
- Fixed issues with the Add Goal button.
- Improved form handling and validation.
- Enhanced error recovery.

### API Client
- Implemented a more robust API client with caching.
- Added retry logic for failed requests.
- Improved error handling.
- Added token refresh mechanism.

## Performance Improvements

### Request Batching
- Combined related API requests to reduce network overhead.
- Implemented caching of related data.

### DOM Manipulation
- Reduced unnecessary DOM updates.
- Improved UI responsiveness.
- Fixed rendering issues.

## Additional Features

### Weekly Distribution Chart
- Added a proper weekly distribution chart.
- Improved data processing for more accurate visualization.
- Fixed data aggregation issues.

### Goal Progress Tracking
- Enhanced goal progress calculation.
- Added visual indicators for goal completion.
- Improved date handling for period-based goals.

## Integration

### File Structure
- The optimized components are located in specific directories:
  - Frontend: `public/js/optimized`
  - Middleware: `middleware/optimized`
  - Models: `models/base`

### Integration Files
- `models/repository-integration.js`: Provides backward compatibility for models.
- `middleware/optimized-integration.js`: Integrates optimized middleware.

## Usage

1. Install the optimizations by running:
   ```
   node install-optimizations.js
   ```

2. Optimize the database by running:
   ```
   psql -U postgres -f optimize_db.sql
   ```

3. Restart the application to see the improvements.
