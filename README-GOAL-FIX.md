# Activity Tracker Goals Display Fix

## Problem

The Activity Tracker application had an issue where goals were being displayed twice when switching between activities or initializing the application.

### Root Cause Analysis:

After reviewing the codebase, I identified that the issue was occurring in `app.js` where there were two separate calls initializing the goals manager when an activity was selected:

1. First initialization: Inside the `activityTypeSelect.addEventListener('change')` function:
   ```javascript
   // Update goals for current activity
   if (window.goalsManager) {
       window.goalsManager.updateActivity(currentActivity);
   }loadLogs();
   loadStats();
       window.goalsManager.init(currentActivity);
   ```

   The issue is that the code first calls `updateActivity()` which loads and renders goals, and then immediately calls `init()` which does the same thing again, resulting in duplicate goal displays.

## Solution

### Approach:

1. Removed the call to `updateActivity()` and kept only the `init()` call, which is the proper way to initialize the goals manager
2. Fixed the code formatting in the activity change event handler
3. Also added proper initialization of the goals manager during initial activity loading and when creating a new activity

### Changes Made:

1. **File Modified**: `app.js` in the `public/js` directory
2. **Original Code**:
   ```javascript
   // Update goals for current activity
   if (window.goalsManager) {
       window.goalsManager.updateActivity(currentActivity);
   }loadLogs();
   loadStats();
       window.goalsManager.init(currentActivity);
   ```

3. **Fixed Code**:
   ```javascript
   // Update goals for current activity
   if (window.goalsManager) {
       window.goalsManager.init(currentActivity);
   }
   loadLogs();
   loadStats();
   ```

4. Also added proper goals initialization when activities are loaded initially and when creating a new activity.

## How to Apply the Fix

1. A backup of your original `app.js` file has been saved to `app.js.backup`
2. The fixed version is available at `fixed-app.js`

To apply the fix:
1. Copy the fixed-app.js file to replace the original:
   ```
   copy fixed-app.js public\js\app.js
   ```

2. Reload the application in your browser and verify that goals are now displayed only once.

## Testing

After applying the fix, you should test the application by:

1. Logging in to the application
2. Verifying that goals are displayed only once for the initial activity
3. Switching between different activities and verifying goals are only displayed once
4. Creating a new activity and verifying goals are initialized correctly
5. Adding a new goal and verifying it appears only once

If you encounter any issues with the fix, you can restore the original version from the backup:
```
copy app.js.backup public\js\app.js
```
