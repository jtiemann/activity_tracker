# Activity Tracker App Fixes

This document outlines the fixes implemented to address issues with the Activity Tracker application.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Login Route Mismatch

**Problem:** The frontend was trying to access `/api/login` but the backend routes were configured under `/api/auth/login`.

**Solution:** 
- Updated the frontend login function to use the correct endpoint path (`/api/auth/login`)
- Added a legacy route to redirect `/api/login` requests to the auth controller for backward compatibility

### 2. SQL Date Operation Error

**Problem:** There was an error in the streak calculation SQL query that caused type mismatch between date and integer.

**Solution:**
- Modified the query in the `checkAchievements` function of `models/achievement.js`
- Added explicit type casting to ensure the date subtraction operation works correctly: `(ROW_NUMBER() OVER (...))::integer`

### 3. Database Schema Completeness

**Problem:** Some database tables might have been missing, particularly for goals functionality.

**Solution:**
- Updated `update_db.sql` to ensure all necessary tables exist
- Added `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` statements for `activity_goals`
- Added indexes for performance optimization

### 4. CORS Configuration

**Problem:** Some API requests might have been blocked due to CORS restrictions.

**Solution:**
- Enhanced CORS middleware configuration to allow all origins
- Added explicit allowed methods and headers

### 5. API Request Logging

**Problem:** Insufficient logging made it difficult to diagnose API issues.

**Solution:**
- Created a dedicated `middleware/logger.js` to log API requests and responses
- Added detailed request body logging for POST/PUT requests
- Implemented response status code logging

### 6. Testing and Diagnostics

**Problem:** Limited ability to test and verify API functionality.

**Solution:**
- Added a comprehensive API test script (`test-api.js`)
- Implemented seven test cases covering critical functionality
- Added a new npm script (`npm run test-api`) to easily run API tests

### 7. Goals Display Duplication

**Problem:** Goals were being displayed twice when switching between activities.

**Solution:**
- Fixed the activity change handler in `app.js` to only initialize goals once
- Removed redundant call to `updateActivity()` which was causing duplicate rendering
- Added proper goals initialization when activities are loaded initially
- Added proper initialization when creating a new activity

## New Files Created

1. `middleware/logger.js` - Enhanced API request/response logging
2. `test-api.js` - API endpoint testing script
3. `FIXES.md` - Documentation of fixes implemented
4. `fixed-app.js` - Fixed version of app.js with goals display fix
5. `README-GOAL-FIX.md` - Documentation of the goals display fix
6. `apply-goal-fix.bat` - Script to apply the goals display fix

## Files Modified

1. `app.js` - Added logger middleware, enhanced CORS settings, fixed goals display
2. `routes/index.js` - Added legacy login route
3. `models/achievement.js` - Fixed date operation error
4. `public/js/app.js` - Updated login endpoint path, fixed goals initialization
5. `update_db.sql` - Added activity_goals table creation
6. `package.json` - Added test-api script and axios dependency

## Running the Tests

After implementing these fixes, you can verify that everything is working correctly by running:

```bash
npm run test-api
```

This will attempt to:
1. Login using both authentication endpoints
2. Retrieve user activities
3. Fetch activity logs
4. Get activity statistics
5. Create a new log entry
6. Retrieve goals
7. Check for achievements

Any issues will be clearly reported in the console output.
